Machine Learning Lab 2
Problem Description

This project predicts customer churn using a classification approach.

Dataset
Customer churn dataset from Kaggle.

Methodology
Diagram generated using AI.

Part 2: Choosing an Open Dataset

I selected a customer churn dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains customer information such as account details, service usage, and churn status. This dataset is suitable for a classification problem because it includes a clear target variable (Churn) and structured tabular data.
